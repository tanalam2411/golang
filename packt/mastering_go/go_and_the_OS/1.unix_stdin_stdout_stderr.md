##### Unix stdin, stdout, and stderr

- Each Unix process has three files open.
- Unix uses `file descriptors`, which are positive integer values, as an internal representation for accessing all of its open files, which is much more convenient that using long paths.

- By default, all Unix systems support three special and standard filenames: 
  - `/dev/stdin`  // standard input
  - `/dev/stdout` // standard output
  - `/dev/stderr` // standard error
  
  or
  - `/dev/fd/0`
  - `/dev/fd/1`
  - `/dev/fd/2`
  
  or 
  - `/dev/pts/0`
  - `/dev/pts/1`
  - `/dev/pts/2`
  
  
  ```bash
  $ file /dev/stdin 
  /dev/stdin: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/0
  $ file /dev/stdout
  /dev/stdout: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/1
  $ file /dev/stderr
  /dev/stderr: symbolic link to /proc/self/fd/2

  ```
  - These file can also be accessed using file descriptors `0, 1 and 2`.
  - Go uses `os.Stdin`, `os.Stdout`, `os.Stderr`, which eventually accesses these file descriptors.
  ```go
    var (
    	Stdin  = NewFile(uintptr(syscall.Stdin), "/dev/stdin")
    	Stdout = NewFile(uintptr(syscall.Stdout), "/dev/stdout")
    	Stderr = NewFile(uintptr(syscall.Stderr), "/dev/stderr")
    )
  ```
